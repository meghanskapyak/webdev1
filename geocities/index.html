            <p class="boxtext">Hi, I'm Meghan! I'm a web design student, artist, and frog enthusiast. I've been the caretaker for over ten frogs throughout my life, and have learned a lot about frogs as a result! This page is a source for information on frogs, a celebration of frogs, and generally just a place where I can store cute pics and gifs of frogs that I like!</p>

            <ul>
                <li>One gram of the toxin produced by the skin of the golden poison dart frog could kill 100,000 people.</li>
                <li>A frog completely sheds its skin about once a week. After it pulls off the old, dead skin, the frog usually eats it.</li>
                <li>A group of birds is called a flock, a group of cattle is called a herd, but a group of frogs is called an army.</li>
                <li>There is a type of poison dart frog called the blue-jeans frog; it has a red body with blue legs. It is also sometimes called the strawberry dart frog.</li>
                <li>There is a frog in Indonesia that has no lungs, it breathes entirely through its skin.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="textcontent">
                Be kind and tender to the Frog,<br>
                And do not call him names,<br>
                As 'Slimy skin,' or 'Polly-wog,'<br>
                Or likewise 'Ugly James,'<br>
                Or 'Gap-a-grin,' or 'Toad-gone-wrong,'<br>
                Or 'Bill Bandy-knees':<br>
                The Frog is justly sensitive<br>
                To epithets like these.<br>
                <br>
                No animal will more repay<br>
                A treatment kind and fair;<br>
                At least so lonely people say<br>
                Who keep a frog (and, by the way,<br>
                They are extremely rare).<br>
                <br>
